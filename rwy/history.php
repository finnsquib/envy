		<h3>ENVY RWY</h3>
		<p>Envy was born from a genuine love of hairdressing, a passion that has
		 continued to grow over the last twelve years. Today, using prestige cut 
		 and color techniques and now employing a team of 30 stylists and junior 
		 stylists, Envy still continues to create effortlessly beautiful hair.</p>
		 <p>Since first opening for business in June 2000, owner Tracie Gunningham 
		 and her staff have been dedicated to giving their customers a highly 
		 professional salon experience. Home to just five styling chairs and three 
		 stylists, Envy soon outgrew its first official premises and Tracie began 
		 the search for a more permanent home. In June 2003, Envy moved to The 
		 Broadway, Plymstock and Envy BWY was born.</p>
		 <p>Envy is not about just about creating gorgeous hair; their ongoing 
		 commitment to staff training has seen the birth of the Academy, giving 
		 trainee hairdressers' the chance to learn in an inspiring and encouraging 
		 environment.</p>
		 <p>In September 2012, with the continued success of ENVY BWY, Tracie was 
		 pleased to announce the launch of her second salon, situated in Plymouth's 
		 prestigious Royal William Yard.</p>
